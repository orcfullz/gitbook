### Tips from successful authors

Once you have a preliminary list, it’s time to refine it by digging deeper. Clarify each stakeholder’s role in relation to your AIP, understand their interests, concerns, or motivations, and assess their level of influence over your proposal’s success.

<details>

<summary>What role does each stakeholder play in relation to the project?</summary>

Understand whether each stakeholder is an internal member shaping the community from within or an external player influencing from the outside. Recognise their unique position and potential impact—whether they are decision-makers, influencers, or those affected by the project's outcomes—so you can tailor your approach to engage them effectively.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are their interests, concerns, or motivations regarding the project?</summary>

Dive deeper into what truly drives each stakeholder. Are they motivated by financial returns, policy adherence, community growth, or something else entirely? By pinpointing their core motivations, you can align your proposal to address their concerns and highlight the benefits that matter most to them.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much influence do they have over the project's success or failure?</summary>

Evaluate the power dynamics at play. Determine who holds significant sway, whose support can accelerate your proposal, or whose opposition could stall it. Knowing their level of influence allows you to prioritize your efforts and strategically engage with those who can shape the project's direction and outcome.
