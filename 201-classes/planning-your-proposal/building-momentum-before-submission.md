# Building Momentum Before Submission

Building momentum is key to driving your Ape Improvement Proposal (AIP) from concept to approval. Momentum starts **before** you submit your AIP—it's the force that keeps you moving forward, ensuring each phase is completed on time and your proposal remains relevant and exciting. This section is all about maintaining that momentum throughout your AIP journey—from the initial concept **before submission** to final approval.

**Why Start Building Momentum Early?**

Momentum keeps your proposal alive and progressing. Without it, even the best ideas can stagnate, causing delays and reducing the likelihood of approval.&#x20;

By building and sustaining momentum **before** you submit your AIP, you ensure that your proposal remains a priority for you, your team, and the stakeholders. Every step taken early brings you closer to your goal and sets a solid foundation for the official proposal process.
