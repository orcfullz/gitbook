# Setting the Stage

***

### **Start and End Dates for Each Phase**

In this section, we'll explore the importance of initiating your project work **before** submitting your Ape Improvement Proposal (AIP). Establishing a strong foundation early isn't just about planning—it's about setting the right cadence for communication, updates, and deliverables from the very beginning. By starting your work ahead of submitting your AIP, you ensure that your project stays on track, maintains momentum, and anticipates and avoids potential slowdowns.

### **Why It Matters**

Just like in music, a steady beat ensures that everyone involved knows what to expect and when. Beginning your project work before submitting your AIP helps manage expectations, reduces stress, and keeps everyone aligned. The right rhythm set early can build trust among stakeholders, provide ample opportunities for feedback, and prevent unnecessary delays.
