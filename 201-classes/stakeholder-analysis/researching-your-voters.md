## **Focusing on Delegates**

Delegates play a crucial role in ApeCoin DAO governance as they vote on behalf of other token holders. Understanding how to engage with and convince these delegates can significantly impact the outcome of your AIP.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Review the Delegate List</strong></td><td>Start with the ApeCoin Delegates List to identify who the delegates are, their voting power, and any statements they’ve made.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Understand Delegate Profiles</strong></td><td>Note which delegates align with your proposal’s goals or who have previously supported similar initiatives.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Leverage AIP Coaches</strong></td><td>Engage with AIP Coaches to gain insights into delegates' priorities, concerns, and voting tendencies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Observe Delegate Communication</strong></td><td>Follow delegates' participation in community discussions on Twitter/X Spaces, Discord, or the ApeCoinDAO forum.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Strategies to Convince Delegates**

Develop a targeted approach to winning over delegates by understanding their priorities, building trust, and positioning your AIP in a way that resonates with their values. Use these strategies to engage effectively, align your goals, and transform delegates from neutral observers into enthusiastic advocates for your proposal.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Strategies</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Build Direct Relationships</strong></td><td>Reach out directly through community channels to discuss your AIP, addressing specific interests or concerns of delegates.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tailor Your Messaging</strong></td><td>Craft messages that resonate with delegates' known priorities, such as enhancing governance, ecosystem improvement, or financial benefits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Engage in Dialogue</strong></td><td>Participate in community calls, forums, and Twitter Spaces to position your proposal effectively, answer questions, and build trust.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Setting Up Your Research "War Room"**

Create a dedicated space to gather and analyze insights, track voting behaviors, and refine your engagement tactics. Your "War Room" is where strategy meets data, equipping you with the information and tools needed to make informed decisions, adapt quickly, and maximise your proposal's impact within the DAO.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Step</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Create a Research Document</strong></td><td>Track findings about potential voters, including delegations, voting behaviours, and key interests.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Identify Influential Delegates and Voters</strong></td><td>Focus on those with significant voting power or influence within the community.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Analyse Voting Patterns and Trends</strong></td><td>Observe repeated behaviours or preferences that could indicate support for your AIP.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shortlist Potential Supporters</strong></td><td>Prioritise those most likely to back your proposal based on your analysis.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Update Your Content and Engagement Plan</strong></td><td>Adapt your messaging to appeal specifically to the delegates and voters you aim to convince.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Actively Engage</strong></td><td>Join relevant community spaces, participate in discussions, and build alliances to rally support for your AIP.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### By thoroughly researching your potential voters and strategically engaging with key delegates, you can build a robust foundation of support and enhance the likelihood of your AIP’s success within the ApeCoin DAO.
