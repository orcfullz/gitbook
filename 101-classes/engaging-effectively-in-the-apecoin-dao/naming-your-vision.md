# Naming Your Vision

{% hint style="info" %}
**Core Question**:&#x20;

How can you encapsulate your entire proposal in a few impactful words?
{% endhint %}

## Your proposal’s name is more than just a label—it's your first impression and an essential part of your branding within the ApeCoin community. A good name should grab attention, convey the core of your idea, and be easy to remember.

<details>

<summary>Why Does a Name Matter?</summary>

**Make a good first Impression**: \
The name is the first thing people see. A compelling name will grab attention and make people want to learn more.

**Providing Clarity**: \
A good name helps people immediately understand what your proposal is about.

**Make it memorable**: \
A concise, meaningful name is easier to remember and reference in discussions, increasing the chances of it being shared.

</details>

### What makes a good name anyway?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Short and Specific**: \
A name like “Streamline DAO Communications” is better than “A Proposal to Make the Communication of the DAO More Efficient.” Fewer words make it easier to digest and remember.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Clear and Descriptive**: \
Names should hint at the proposal's essence. “AIP: Grant Program for Innovative Tools” clearly conveys the proposal's focus.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Avoid Jargon**: \
Don’t use highly technical terms or internal jargon that might not be understood by everyone in the community. Keep it accessible.
{% endhint %}

## _**Examples of Good vs. Bad Names:**_

{% hint style="success" %}
### “Budget Transparency Initiative”
{% endhint %}

_Why?_ It’s clear, short, and tells the reader exactly what the proposal is aiming to achieve.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**“An Initiative for Improving the Transparency of the Budget Allocation and Expenditure Reporting Process Within the ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem”**
{% endhint %}

_Why?_ It’s long-winded, overly complex, and doesn’t get to the point quickly.

### **Questions to push you:**

<details>

<summary>Is your proposal name concise (under 5 words)?</summary>

If not, break it back down into the fundamentals of what you're trying to address, keep it simple.&#x20;



**What to keep an eye on:**

* **Word Count Check**: Count the number of words in your proposed title. If it exceeds five, consider which words can be trimmed without losing meaning.
* **Word Efficiency**: Assess if each word in your title adds value. If a word can be removed without altering the meaning, it’s likely unnecessary.
* **Consider Synonyms**: Look for shorter synonyms that convey the same meaning, helping to reduce word count.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does the name convey the core idea or objective?</summary>

If not, what bits are missing? break it down into the most basic fundamentals of what you're trying to achieve and build back up from there.

**What you should keep an eye on:**

* **Core Concept Identification**: Identify the primary goal or theme of your proposal. Ensure that your title reflects this clearly.
* **Keyword Focus**: Make sure the most important keyword(s) of your proposal are in the title. For example, if your proposal is about funding, include "funding" or "grant" in the title.
* **Avoid Ambiguity**: Ensure that your title doesn’t leave room for multiple interpretations. The reader should understand the main focus immediately.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is it free from technical jargon or overly complex language?</summary>

If not, how can you simplify the language to make it easier for anyone in the community to engage with it?

What you should keep an eye on:

* **Audience Awareness**: Consider your audience. Will someone outside your specific field understand the title? If not, simplify the language.
* **Plain Language Test**: Replace any industry-specific terms with plain language. If a term is necessary, consider using a simpler word or adding a brief definition elsewhere in the proposal.
* **Readability Check**: Read your title out loud. If it’s a mouthful or awkward to say, it might be too complex and should be simplified.

</details>

### **An example pre and post application:**

**Original Title**: "Implementing Decentralised Autonomous Governance Modules in the ApeCoin Ecosystem"

**Subpoints Applied**:

1. **Is your proposal name concise?**
   * The original title has seven words. We could shorten it to "Decentralised Governance in ApeCoin."
2. **Does it convey the core idea or objective?**
   * The original title does convey the idea but is somewhat vague. We could clarify with something like "ApeCoin DAO Governance Enhancement" to focus on the "governance" aspect.
3. **Is it free from technical jargon or overly complex language?**
   * The term "Modules" might be confusing to some. Simplifying to "Governance Enhancement" makes it clearer and avoids unnecessary complexity.

**Revised Title**: "ApeCoin Governance Enhancement"

By addressing each probing question with these sub-points, you can refine your proposal name to be clear, concise, and impactful.

### **Tips from successful Authors:**

<details>

<summary>Test different names with a few peers to see which is more memorable.</summary>

When you share 2-3 different potential names, continue the conversation and then ask them to try and share back the name of your AIP; see which bits stuck and why.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Avoid acronyms unless they are very well-known within the ApeCoin community.</summary>

Don't accidentally alienate people who want to engage but you have accidentally pushed out.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Think about the SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) potential—will people find it if they search for related terms?</summary>

Even inside of the forums, Discourse or on Discord, How easy would it be for someone to find it with 1 or 2 of the words in your AIP name?
