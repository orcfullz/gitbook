# Naming Your Vision

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Naming Your Vision - 1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Core Question**:&#x20;

How can you encapsulate your entire proposal in a few impactful words?
{% endhint %}

## Your proposal’s name is more than just a label—it's your first impression and an essential part of your branding within the ApeCoin community. A good name should grab attention, convey the core of your idea, and be easy to remember.

<details>

<summary>Why Does a Name Matter?</summary>

**Make a good first Impression**: \
The name is the first thing people see. A compelling name will grab attention and make people want to learn more.

**Providing Clarity**: \
A good name helps people immediately understand what your proposal is about.

**Make it memorable**: \
A concise, meaningful name is easier to remember and reference in discussions, increasing the chances of it being shared.

</details>

### What makes a good name anyway?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Short and Specific**: \
A name like “Streamline DAO Communications” is better than “A Proposal to Make the Communication of the DAO More Efficient.” Fewer words make it easier to digest and remember.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Clear and Descriptive**: \
Names should hint at the proposal's essence. “AIP: Grant Program for Innovative Tools” clearly conveys the proposal's focus.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Avoid Jargon**: \
Don’t use highly technical terms or internal jargon that might not be understood by everyone in the community. Keep it accessible.
{% endhint %}

## _**Examples of Good vs. Bad Names:**_

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Naming Your Vision - 2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visuals: I think maybe the section below (Good and Bad names) Can be blown up to be a sign by sign comparision. Think this will make it eye catching enough for people to digest in a glance]</mark>

{% hint style="success" %}
### “Budget Transparency Initiative”
{% endhint %}

_Why?_ It’s clear, short, and tells the reader exactly what the proposal is aiming to achieve.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**“An Initiative for Improving the Transparency of the Budget Allocation and Expenditure Reporting Process Within the ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem”**
{% endhint %}

_Why?_ It’s long-winded, overly complex, and doesn’t get to the point quickly.

### **Questions to push you:**

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visuals: Maybe something like 5 blank underscores]</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Naming Your Vision - 3.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>Is your proposal name concise (under 5 words)?</summary>

If not, break it back down into the fundamentals of what you're trying to address, keep it simple.&#x20;



**What to keep an eye on:**

* **Word Count Check**: Count the number of words in your proposed title. If it exceeds five, consider which words can be trimmed without losing meaning.
* **Word Efficiency**: Assess if each word in your title adds value. If a word can be removed without altering the meaning, it’s likely unnecessary.
* **Consider Synonyms**: Look for shorter synonyms that convey the same meaning, helping to reduce word count.

</details>

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visuals: 2 comparision of good names vs vague naming]</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Naming Your Vision - 4.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>Does the name convey the core idea or objective?</summary>

If not, what bits are missing? break it down into the most basic fundamentals of what you're trying to achieve and build back up from there.

**What you should keep an eye on:**

* **Core Concept Identification**: Identify the primary goal or theme of your proposal. Ensure that your title reflects this clearly.
* **Keyword Focus**: Make sure the most important keyword(s) of your proposal are in the title. For example, if your proposal is about funding, include "funding" or "grant" in the title.
* **Avoid Ambiguity**: Ensure that your title doesn’t leave room for multiple interpretations. The reader should understand the main focus immediately.

</details>

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visuals: 2 Comparison of simple language vs technical jargon]</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Naming Your Vision - 6.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<details>

<summary>Is it free from technical jargon or overly complex language?</summary>

If not, how can you simplify the language to make it easier for anyone in the community to engage with it?

What you should keep an eye on:

* **Audience Awareness**: Consider your audience. Will someone outside your specific field understand the title? If not, simplify the language.
* **Plain Language Test**: Replace any industry-specific terms with plain language. If a term is necessary, consider using a simpler word or adding a brief definition elsewhere in the proposal.
* **Readability Check**: Read your title out loud. If it’s a mouthful or awkward to say, it might be too complex and should be simplified.

</details>

### **An example pre and post application:**

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Maybe for this part it can hidden in a tab, only expand if reader needs it. If not it might seem to repetitive]</mark>

**Original Title**: "Implementing Decentralised Autonomous Governance Modules in the ApeCoin Ecosystem"

**Subpoints Applied**:

1. **Is your proposal name concise?**
   * The original title has seven words. We could shorten it to "Decentralised Governance in ApeCoin."
2. **Does it convey the core idea or objective?**
   * The original title does convey the idea but is somewhat vague. We could clarify with something like "ApeCoin DAO Governance Enhancement" to focus on the "governance" aspect.
3. **Is it free from technical jargon or overly complex language?**
   * The term "Modules" might be confusing to some. Simplifying to "Governance Enhancement" makes it clearer and avoids unnecessary complexity.

**Revised Title**: "ApeCoin Governance Enhancement"

By addressing each probing question with these sub-points, you can refine your proposal name to be clear, concise, and impactful.

### **Tips from successful Authors:**

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visuals: Maybe we can make a compliation of ape profile photos? Or maybe just a. big pen. Might even be able to just change the colour for this section. Should be able to differential visually that this is just an addtional tip.]</mark>

<details>

<summary>Test different names with a few peers to see which is more memorable.</summary>

When you share 2-3 different potential names, continue the conversation and then ask them to try and share back the name of your AIP; see which bits stuck and why.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Avoid acronyms unless they are very well-known within the ApeCoin community.</summary>

Don't accidentally alienate people who want to engage but you have accidentally pushed out.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Think about the SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) potential—will people find it if they search for related terms?</summary>

Even inside of the forums, Discourse or on Discord, How easy would it be for someone to find it with 1 or 2 of the words in your AIP name?
