## **Focusing on Delegates**

Delegates play a crucial role in ApeCoin DAO governance as they vote on behalf of other token holders. Understanding how to engage with and convince these delegates can significantly impact the outcome of your AIP.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Review the Delegate List</strong></td><td>Start with the ApeCoin Delegates List to identify who the delegates are, their voting power, and any statements they’ve made.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Understand Delegate Profiles</strong></td><td>Note which delegates align with your proposal’s goals or who have previously supported similar initiatives.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Leverage AIP Coaches</strong></td><td>Engage with AIP Coaches to gain insights into delegates' priorities, concerns, and voting tendencies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Observe Delegate Communication</strong></td><td>Follow delegates' participation in community discussions on Twitter/X Spaces, Discord, or the ApeCoinDAO forum.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Strategies to Convince Delegates**

Develop a targeted approach to winning over delegates by understanding their priorities, building trust, and positioning your AIP in a way that resonates with their values. Use these strategies to engage effectively, align your goals, and transform delegates from neutral observers into enthusiastic advocates for your proposal.
