# Crafting a Compelling Overview

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Crafting - 1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## What is the essence of your proposal, and why does it matter to the ApeCoin community?&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visual: Might be as simple as a proposal letter or envelope on a hook]</mark>

Think of this section as the hook that grabs attention. Your proposal description should provide a snapshot that clearly communicates the core idea, goals, and expected impact. This will be the first thing that voters see on Snapshot, so it needs to be compelling and succinct.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What We’re Aiming to Achieve:**

We aim to help you distill your proposal down to its most powerful, understandable form. A great description isn’t just about summarizing; it’s about making your proposal instantly resonate with those who read it. By crafting a concise overview, you increase the chances of your AIP gaining traction and support within the community.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Picture yourself in a room full of DAO members, and you have only 30 seconds to get them excited about your idea.**

What would you say? Focus on the “why” of your proposal—the unique value or change it brings to the ApeCoin ecosystem. Be clear, passionate, and direct.

### **What is the core idea of your proposal?**

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Added bold 1 liner: "Explain the problem!" "Tell us why this solution is different" "Get to the point"]</mark>

<details>

<summary><strong>What problem does it solve?</strong></summary>

Every proposal should address a specific problem or gap in the ApeCoin ecosystem. Clearly define what issue you're tackling and why it matters.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What’s the unique angle?</strong></summary>

Highlight what sets your proposal apart from similar ideas or existing solutions. Is there a novel approach, new technology, or unique perspective involved?

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Can it be summed up in a sentence?</strong></summary>

Try to create a one-sentence version of your proposal. If you can't, it might not be focused enough.

</details>

### Why is it important to the ApeCoin ecosystem?

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Added bold 1 liner: "Talk long term, talk future" "Tell us the impact!" "Potential danger/Risk if we don't take action now!"]</mark>

<details>

<summary><strong>What’s the bigger picture?</strong></summary>

Explain how your proposal aligns with the long-term goals or values of the ApeCoin DAO. Think beyond immediate benefits—consider its impact on governance, community engagement, or future growth.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Who benefits and how?</strong></summary>

Identify the stakeholders or community members who stand to gain the most from your proposal. How does it enhance their experience or add value?

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What’s at stake if it doesn’t happen?</strong></summary>

Consider outlining the potential consequences of not implementing your proposal. What opportunities could be missed?

</details>

### What are the expected outcomes or benefits?

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Added bold 1 liner: "Talk long term, talk future" "Tell us the impact!" "Potential danger/Risk if we don't take action now!"]</mark>

<details>

<summary><strong>What measurable impact will it have?</strong></summary>

Outline the key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics that will help measure the success of your proposal.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What are the tangible benefits?</strong></summary>

Describe specific, concrete outcomes—like increased user engagement, better governance processes, or community expansion.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What’s the return on investment (ROI)?</summary>

If your proposal requires funding, explain how the benefits justify the cost. Make a case for the value of the investment. It doesn't always have to be a Monterey return, value can be diverse.&#x20;

### All of these have the following in common at their core

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Possible to create a circular graph and have them expand outwards with the 3 principles.]</mark>

* **Highlight Key Outcomes**: Mention what will change or improve if the proposal passes.
* **Show Alignment with ApeCoin DAO Goals**: Link your proposal to the overall objectives and values of the DAO.
* **Keep It Engaging**: Use simple language and avoid jargon to make the description accessible to all voters.

### By incorporating these best practices and examples, you can craft a more compelling and effective "Proposal Description" that resonates with the ApeCoin DAO community and increases your chances of approval.
