# Defining Your Roadmap

## Building a great AIP isn’t just about vision; it’s about execution.

And execution starts with a clear roadmap. Your project’s phases and milestones are the foundation upon which everything else is built. This section will guide you through defining these essential components, ensuring your project moves forward in a structured and efficient way.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why This Matters**

Breaking down your project into well-defined phases and setting key milestones isn’t just a best practice; it’s crucial for maintaining momentum, managing resources, and aligning everyone involved. Think of your roadmap as the backbone of your project—without it, even the best ideas can fall apart.
{% endhint %}

### **Laying Out Your Phases:** The Building Blocks of Your Project

To successfully navigate your AIP through the various stages of the DAO's approval and implementation process, it’s essential to establish clear milestones. Think of these as critical checkpoints that ensure your proposal is on track, transparent, and accountable. Here’s how to set up milestones specific to the AIP journey:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards" data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Definition </th><th>Key Activities	</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1: Planning Phase</strong></td><td>The initial stage where objectives, scope, and deliverables are defined.</td><td>Define project objectives, scope, and deliverables; identify stakeholders; develop an initial project plan; conduct a risk assessment.</td><td>Sets the foundation for the project by aligning all stakeholders and preventing scope creep.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2: Development Phase</strong></td><td>The phase where ideas are transformed into tangible components or outputs.</td><td>Design and develop project components; perform initial testing; gather feedback; refine and iterate based on feedback.</td><td>Ensures that the project stays aligned with the goals and stakeholder expectations through continuous feedback and iteration.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3: Implementation Phase</strong></td><td>The stage where the project components are deployed, tested comprehensively, and prepared for user adoption.</td><td>Deploy project components; conduct comprehensive testing; train users; collect final feedback.</td><td>Successful implementation ensures the project works as intended and is well-received by end-users, minimising post-launch issues.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4: Evaluation Phase</strong></td><td>The final phase to assess the project’s outcomes, document lessons learned, and complete the project.</td><td>Assess project outcomes; document lessons learned; finalise project reports; celebrate project completion.</td><td>Provides valuable insights for future projects by understanding what worked well and what could be improved.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Step 1: Create a Stakeholder List

To effectively identify stakeholders, it's important to ask the right questions that help you understand who might be impacted by or interested in your project. Use these questions as a guide to create a comprehensive list of stakeholders and define their roles.

## **Guiding Your Project Path: Preparation Steps**

**Every successful AIP starts with thoughtful preparation and a well-laid plan.** \
This section is all about equipping yourself with the right tools, steps, and strategies to create a roadmap that is both comprehensive and actionable. Let’s dive into the key elements that will guide your AIP journey from idea to submission!

### **1. Making Your Progress Tangible: Why KPIs Matter**

Think of KPIs as your project's personal fitness tracker. They help you see how far you've come and how close you are to reaching your goals, one step at a time. By setting clear KPIs for each phase, you give yourself and your team a way to celebrate wins, spot roadblocks early, and keep everyone moving in the right direction. Here’s how to get started:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards" data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Example KPI</th><th>Why It Matters</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Concept Development</td><td>Initial feedback from 3 key community members</td><td>Ensures the proposal aligns with community expectations early on and identifies potential issues before submission.</td><td>Sets the foundation for the project by aligning all stakeholders and preventing scope creep.</td></tr><tr><td>Drafting and Refinement</td><td>Completion of the first draft by [Date]</td><td>Keeps the project on schedule and allows time for iterations based on feedback.</td><td>Ensures that the project stays aligned with the goals and stakeholder expectations through continuous feedback and iteration.</td></tr><tr><td>Peer Review and Iteration</td><td>Incorporation of all received feedback</td><td>Ensures that all community concerns are addressed and the proposal is as strong as possible before submission.</td><td>Successful implementation ensures the project works as intended and is well-received by end-users, minimising post-launch issues.</td></tr><tr><td>Final Documentation</td><td>Final draft approved by all stakeholders by [Date]</td><td>Confirms that all involved parties are in agreement and the proposal is ready for submission, minimising the chances of rejection or revisions.</td><td>Provides valuable insights for future projects by understanding what worked well and what could be improved.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **2. Think of risk management as packing an umbrella just in case it rains—you’re preparing for what **_**could**_** happen, not what you **_**hope**_** will happen.**

By identifying possible challenges and planning your response in advance, you can keep your proposal on track no matter what surprises come your way. Here’s how to be ready:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards" data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Potential Risk</th><th>Mitigation Strategy</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Concept Development</td><td>Delayed feedback from key stakeholders</td><td>Schedule early feedback sessions and build buffer time into your timeline.</td><td>Sets the foundation for the project by aligning all stakeholders and preventing scope creep.</td></tr><tr><td>Drafting and Refinement</td><td>Incomplete drafts or missing details</td><td>Conduct regular check-ins with your team; assign specific responsibilities for each draft component.</td><td>Ensures that the project stays aligned with the goals and stakeholder expectations through continuous feedback and iteration.</td></tr><tr><td>Peer Review and Iteration</td><td>Conflict in community feedback</td><td>Prioritise feedback based on its alignment with the AIP’s goals and seek clarification where needed.</td><td>Successful implementation ensures the project works as intended and is well-received by end-users, minimising post-launch issues.</td></tr><tr><td>Final Documentation</td><td>Last-minute changes requested by reviewers</td><td>Set a deadline for final changes well ahead of the submission date to accommodate any unforeseen edits.</td><td>Provides valuable insights for future projects by understanding what worked well and what could be improved.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **3.** Think of feedback as a gift—it might not always be what you expect, but it always offers a chance to make your proposal better.&#x20;

Regularly check in with your community and stakeholders, gather input, and adjust accordingly.  The more you know, the stronger your AIP will be! We go much deeper into this subject in [stakeholder-feedback.md](../stakeholder-analysis/stakeholder-feedback.md "mention") later!

<table data-view="cards" data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Feedback Point	</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Suggested Methods</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>After the Initial Draft</td><td>Identify major concerns and align with community needs</td><td>Use community forums, surveys, or direct outreach to key members.</td><td>Sets the foundation for the project by aligning all stakeholders and preventing scope creep.</td></tr><tr><td>Midway Through Refinement</td><td>Validate changes and refine the approach</td><td>Host a Q&#x26;A session or a feedback roundtable.</td><td>Ensures that the project stays aligned with the goals and stakeholder expectations through continuous feedback and iteration.</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Final Submission</td><td>Confirm all feedback has been addressed</td><td>Conduct a final survey or use feedback forms.</td><td>Successful implementation ensures the project works as intended and is well-received by end-users, minimising post-launch issues.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **4. Crafting a Better Proposal: Refinement and Iteration Plans**

Consider iteration like polishing a gem. Each round of revisions makes your proposal shine a little brighter and more ready for submission. Plan for multiple revisions and use feedback to continuously refine your AIP.

<table data-view="cards" data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Iteration Round	</th><th>Objective</th><th>Sub-Milestones</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Initial Refinement</td><td>Incorporate primary feedback and adjust major components</td><td>Update key sections, review language for clarity, adjust goals.</td><td>Sets the foundation for the project by aligning all stakeholders and preventing scope creep.</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary Refinement</td><td>Fine-tune details based on additional input</td><td>Validate changes with a smaller group, finalize data points.</td><td>Ensures that the project stays aligned with the goals and stakeholder expectations through continuous feedback and iteration.</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Submission Polishing</td><td>Finalise the proposal and ensure compliance with guidelines</td><td>Final formatting checks, align with AIP template requirements.</td><td>Successful implementation ensures the project works as intended and is well-received by end-users, minimising post-launch issues.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **5. The Final Countdown: Checklist for Readiness**

Before you hit “Submit,” make sure everything is in place. Think of this checklist as your last-minute prep before a big presentation—everything needs to be perfect, polished, and ready to go.

**A basic Checklist to copy and build on**

* [ ] <mark style="background-color:yellow;">All sections of the AIP filled out</mark>
* [ ] <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Feedback incorporated and documented</mark>
