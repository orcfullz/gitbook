# Stakeholder Identification

**Stakeholders** are individuals or groups who have an interest in your project or are affected by its outcomes. Identifying your stakeholders is the first step to engaging them effectively.

#### Step 1: Create a Stakeholder List

To effectively identify stakeholders, it's important to ask the right questions that help you understand who might be impacted by or interested in your project. Use these questions as a guide to create a comprehensive list of stakeholders and define their roles.

### **Questions to Ask Yourself:**

<details>

<summary><strong>Who has an interest in the success or failure of the project?</strong></summary>

Consider those who are not directly affected but who have a vested interest in the project's outcome. This could include people who support or oppose the project for various reasons.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Who needs to be informed about the project?</strong></summary>

Identify individuals or groups who must be kept in the loop, even if they are not actively participating in the project. This could include higher-level decision-makers, regulatory bodies, or community members.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Who will be directly affected by the project’s outcomes?</strong></summary>

Think about individuals or groups who will see a direct impact from the project's results. Are there people whose work, investment, or daily routines might change because of what you’re doing?

</details>

### **Questions to Ask Yourself once you have a list of potentials:**

<details>

<summary><strong>What role does each stakeholder play in relation to the project?</strong></summary>

Determine whether they are internal (part of the organisation/community) or external (outside of the organisation/community).

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are their interests, concerns, or motivations regarding the project?</summary>

Understand what drives each stakeholder. Are they looking for a return on investment, policy compliance, community impact, or something else?

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much influence do they have over the project's success or failure?</summary>

Assess whether their input or actions could significantly shape the direction or outcome of the project.

</details>
