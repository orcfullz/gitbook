## Introduction

> _"There's so many ways to participate in the DAO, and it's not always rigid and straightforward. Once you find that good person, you have to be able to keep them, because having an AIP approved and seeing that on your discourse profile is one of the most gratifying feelings. The true nature of a person comes out when they think no one's watching, so itâ€™s crucial to engage with stakeholders in a way that reflects integrity and genuine collaboration. Find your happy spot and put it in your opening line, because effective stakeholder engagement is about fostering relationships that last beyond just one proposal."_
