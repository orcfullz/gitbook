# Stakeholder Mapping

{% hint style="info" %}
**Stakeholder Mapping** helps you visualise where stakeholders fall in terms of their level of interest in your project and their ability to influence its outcome. This process allows you to prioritise your engagement efforts.
{% endhint %}

### **Mapping** Stakeholder Dynamics: The Interest-Influence Matrix

Building a dynamic Interest and Influence Matrix allows you to visualise where each stakeholder stands in relation to your project—mapping out their level of interest and ability to influence its outcome. This approach helps you prioritise who to engage with and how intensely, while also providing a clear picture of how your stakeholder landscape evolves over time. By regularly updating this matrix, you can adapt your strategies as new stakeholders emerge or existing ones shift their positions, ensuring you remain agile and responsive to the needs and power dynamics of the ApeCoin DAO.

### **Why gauging interest is important**

Understanding a stakeholder’s level of interest helps you gauge how much they care about your project's details, decisions, and outcomes. This insight allows you to tailor your communication and engagement strategies to keep them informed and involved, ensuring their ongoing support and minimising any potential objections.

{% hint style="info" %}
**'Interest' in short**: The degree to which a stakeholder is interested in the project.
{% endhint %}

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Level of interest</th><th>What defines them</th><th>Question to ask yourself</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Low</strong> </td><td><strong>Minimal interest in project details.</strong></td><td><em>"Is this stakeholder only minimally interested in the project's details and outcomes, or only tangentially aware of it?"</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Medium</strong> </td><td><strong>Interested in regular updates and major decisions.</strong></td><td><em>"Does this stakeholder want regular updates and information about major decisions but is not deeply involved in every detail?"</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>High</strong></td><td><strong>Highly invested in the project's outcomes and processes.</strong></td><td><em>"Is this stakeholder deeply invested in the outcomes and processes of my project? Are they actively seeking information or engaging in discussions about it?"</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Why gauging interest is important**

Assessing a stakeholder's influence determines their capacity to affect your project's direction and outcomes. By identifying those with the highest influence, you can focus your efforts on gaining their support or addressing their concerns, significantly enhancing your chances of achieving project success.

{% hint style="info" %}
**'Influence' in short**: The degree to which a stakeholder can impact the project.
{% endhint %}

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Level of Influence</th><th>What defines them</th><th>Question to ask yourself</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Low</strong> </td><td><strong>Limited ability to affect the project's direction.</strong></td><td>Does this stakeholder have little to no ability to affect the project's direction or outcome?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Medium</strong> </td><td><strong>Can influence some project decisions.</strong></td><td>Can this stakeholder influence some aspects of the project, such as specific decisions or phases, but not the overall direction?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>High</strong></td><td><strong>Significant influence over project outcomes.</strong></td><td><p>Does this stakeholder have a significant ability to shape or change the direction of the project? </p><p></p><p>Could their support or opposition dramatically affect the project's success?</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Examples of what the outcome might look like

Your focus should be on arming yourself with the knowledge around the importance of and  level of communication you need to have with each of these stakeholders

<table data-view="cards" data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Stakeholder Name</th><th>Interest</th><th>Influence</th><th>Matrix Position</th><th>Why?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ApeCoinDAO Members</td><td>High </td><td>High</td><td>(High, High)</td><td>Reason it sits here in the matrix.</td></tr><tr><td>AIP Authors </td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td><td>(High, Medium)</td><td>Reason it sits here in the matrix.</td></tr><tr><td>DAO Governance Team </td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>(High, High)</td><td>Reason it sits here in the matrix.</td></tr><tr><td>Partners </td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td><td>(Medium, Medium)</td><td>Reason it sits here in the matrix.</td></tr><tr><td>Regulatory Bodies </td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>(High, Low)</td><td>Reason it sits here in the matrix.</td></tr><tr><td>Investors</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>(Medium, High)</td><td>Reason it sits here in the matrix.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### A hypothetical example for reference

Proposal to Develop an Open-Source Developer Toolkit for Building Decentralized Applications (dApps) on ApeChain.

<table data-view="cards" data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Stakeholder Name</th><th>Interest</th><th>Influence</th><th>Matrix Position</th><th>Why?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Active DAO Members</td><td>High </td><td>High</td><td>(High, High)</td><td>They have high interest and influence as they actively vote on proposals and benefit from tools that expand the ecosystem and enhance the utility of ApeCoin.</td></tr><tr><td>Proposal Creators and Contributors</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td><td>(High, Medium)</td><td>They are highly interested because the toolkit could simplify the development process, making it easier to propose and build new projects, but their direct influence on governance decisions may be more limited.</td></tr><tr><td>Special Council Members</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>(High, High)</td><td>They have both high interest and influence as they ensure the proposal aligns with the strategic goals of the DAO and adheres to governance standards.</td></tr><tr><td>Strategic Partners and Collaborators </td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td><td>(Medium, Medium)</td><td>They are interested in collaborative opportunities to build and integrate with ApeChain, enhancing their own projects, but their influence is moderate regarding direct DAO decisions.</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Regulators, Compliance Authorities</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>(High, Low)</td><td>Their interest is low unless regulatory concerns arise, but their influence is high since they ensure that the DAO activities comply with regulations.</td></tr><tr><td>Major Token Holders and Speculators</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>(Medium, High)</td><td>Investors have a high interest in projects that drive ecosystem growth and increase token utility, impacting the value of their investments, and they hold significant influence over financial aspects of the DAO.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Great, now let's talk about how to effectively research into these groups
