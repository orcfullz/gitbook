# Stakeholder Mapping

{% hint style="info" %}
**Stakeholder Mapping** helps you visualise where stakeholders fall in terms of their level of interest in your project and their ability to influence its outcome. This process allows you to prioritise your engagement efforts.
{% endhint %}

### **Mapping** Stakeholder Dynamics: The Interest-Influence Matrix

Building a dynamic Interest and Influence Matrix allows you to visualise where each stakeholder stands in relation to your project—mapping out their level of interest and ability to influence its outcome. This approach helps you prioritise who to engage with and how intensely, while also providing a clear picture of how your stakeholder landscape evolves over time. By regularly updating this matrix, you can adapt your strategies as new stakeholders emerge or existing ones shift their positions, ensuring you remain agile and responsive to the needs and power dynamics of the ApeCoin DAO.

### **Why gauging interest is important**

Understanding a stakeholder’s level of interest helps you gauge how much they care about your project's details, decisions, and outcomes. This insight allows you to tailor your communication and engagement strategies to keep them informed and involved, ensuring their ongoing support and minimising any potential objections.

{% hint style="info" %}
**'Interest' in short**: The degree to which a stakeholder is interested in the project.
{% endhint %}

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visual for each box, maybe colour or some sort of phone signal intensitiy level bar or something]</mark>

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Level of interest</th><th>What defines them</th><th>Question to ask yourself</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Low</strong> </td><td><strong>Minimal interest in project details.</strong></td><td><em>"Is this stakeholder only minimally interested in the project's details and outcomes, or only tangentially aware of it?"</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Medium</strong> </td><td><strong>Interested in regular updates and major decisions.</strong></td><td><em>"Does this stakeholder want regular updates and information about major decisions but is not deeply involved in every detail?"</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>High</strong></td><td><strong>Highly commited in the project's outcomes and processes.</strong></td><td><em>"Is this stakeholder deeply commited to the outcomes and processes of my project? Are they actively seeking information or engaging in discussions about it?"</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Why gauging interest is important**

Assessing a stakeholder's influence determines their capacity to affect your project's direction and outcomes. By identifying those with the highest influence, you can focus your efforts on gaining their support or addressing their concerns, significantly enhancing your chances of achieving project success.

{% hint style="info" %}
**'Influence' in short**: The degree to which a stakeholder can impact the project.
{% endhint %}

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visual for each box, maybe colour or some sort of phone signal intensitiy level bar or something]</mark>

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Level of Influence</th><th>What defines them</th><th>Question to ask yourself</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Low</strong> </td><td><strong>Limited ability to affect the project's direction.</strong></td><td>Does this stakeholder have little to no ability to affect the project's direction or outcome?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Medium</strong> </td><td><strong>Can influence some project decisions.</strong></td><td>Can this stakeholder influence some aspects of the project, such as specific decisions or phases, but not the overall direction?</td></tr><tr><td><strong>High</strong></td><td><strong>Significant influence over project outcomes.</strong></td><td><p>Does this stakeholder have a significant ability to shape or change the direction of the project? </p><p></p><p>Could their support or opposition dramatically affect the project's success?</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### A hypothetical example of what outcome might look like, for reference&#x20;

Proposal to Develop an Open-Source Developer Toolkit for Building Decentralized Applications (dApps) on ApeChain.

### Great, now let's talk about how to effectively research into these groups
