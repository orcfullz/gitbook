# Stakeholder Analysis

## Your Guide to Engaging Effectively in the ApeCoin DAO

Welcome to Stakeholder Analysis 201! In this module, we go beyond the basics covered in 101 and dive into advanced strategies for engaging effectively with the ApeCoin DAO community.&#x20;

This is your opportunity to take what you’ve learned and elevate it—deepening your understanding, sharpening your tactics, and truly mastering the art of stakeholder engagement for your Ape Improvement Proposal (AIP).

### **Key Outcomes of Stakeholder Analysis 201**:

By the end of this module, you'll be equipped to not just engage stakeholders but to truly mobilise the community behind your AIP, ensuring your proposal resonates and gains the momentum needed to succeed.
