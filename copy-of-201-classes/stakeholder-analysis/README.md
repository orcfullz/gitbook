Now that you’re mid-way through the 201 modules, it's time to dig deeper into understanding how to effectively engage the community around your Ape Improvement Proposal (AIP).

This section brings together insights and strategies to help you master stakeholder identification, mapping, engagement, and feedback. You'll learn how to research and understand your voters, align your proposal with their interests, and build strong support networks within the ApeCoin DAO. By effectively managing these elements, you’ll not only increase your chances of passing your AIP but also contribute to a more dynamic and collaborative DAO environment.

Dive in with an open mind, leverage these tools and techniques, and start applying them to make your AIP stand out and resonate with those who matter most. This is your guide to transforming stakeholders from passive observers into active supporters—let’s get started!
