# Your Blueprint for AIP Success

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visual: Road map examples. Phases 1 Phases 2 etc]</mark>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Your Blueprint - 1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Building a great AIP isn’t just about having a vision; it’s about creating a clear plan that leads you step-by-step toward that vision. Think of this section as your blueprint—the foundation that will guide you from where you are now to where you want to be. A solid roadmap gives you the confidence to execute your proposal while showing the community that you’ve thought of everything and are ready to deliver.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What We’re Aiming to Achieve:**

We aim to help you distill your proposal down to its most powerful, understandable form. A great description isn’t just about summarising; it’s about making your proposal instantly resonate with those who read it. By crafting a concise overview, you increase the chances of your AIP gaining traction and support within the community.

### Laying Out Your Phases: The Building Blocks of Your Project

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visuals Have 4 different blocks or shapes and label them as the 4 different phases]</mark>\
To help you get started, let's break down your AIP into four distinct phases. Think of these as the building blocks that make your project manageable, trackable, and most importantly, achievable.

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Description</th><th>How to Approach It	</th><th>Questions to Ask Yourself</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01 Planning Phase</td><td>Define your project’s objectives, scope, and deliverables. Develop a project plan outlining risks, resources, and timelines.</td><td>This is your foundation. Be clear about your objectives and get buy-in from all stakeholders. Are there any risks you need to consider?</td><td>“Have I clearly outlined the project’s objectives and scope? Have I planned for potential risks and resource needs?”</td></tr><tr><td>02 Development Phase</td><td>Implement the ideas and features of your proposal, and gather feedback.</td><td>Focus on building your project piece by piece. Engage with stakeholders to get feedback early and often.</td><td>“Are we on track with the development timeline? Are we gathering enough feedback to iterate and improve?”</td></tr><tr><td>03 Implementation Phase</td><td>Deploy the project to the community, ensure all communications are clear, and support is provided.</td><td>Roll out your project with clear instructions and support. Monitor engagement closely and be ready to pivot if needed.</td><td>“Are we ready to go live? Do we have a plan for post-launch support?”</td></tr><tr><td>04 Evaluation Phase</td><td>Review outcomes, gather feedback, and identify areas for improvement.</td><td>Take the time to evaluate your project’s successes and learn from any challenges. Document what worked and what didn’t for future projects.</td><td>“What did we do well? What could have gone better? What will we do differently next time?”</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Markers of Progress: Setting Your Milestones

Milestones are like the trail markers on your journey; they help you see where you are, where you’re headed, and how much progress you've made. Here's how to set them up:\
\[I feel that below it is not really teaching people how to set up their own milestones but instead it feels like it's telling them what their milestone should be instead.]

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th>Milestone</th><th>Description</th><th>How to Know You’re Ready to Move On	</th><th>Typical Sub-Milestones</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Concept Development and Initial Feedback</td><td>Develop your core idea, gather initial feedback, and refine your proposal accordingly.</td><td>You’ve clearly outlined your goals, collected community feedback, and adjusted your proposal based on that input.</td><td>Outline core idea, gather initial feedback from community, refine the draft based on feedback.</td></tr><tr><td>Peer Review and Iteration</td><td>Engage with more community members for feedback and make necessary refinements.</td><td>You’ve incorporated feedback from multiple stakeholders and addressed major concerns raised by them.</td><td>Complete a second draft, gather feedback from peers, refine the draft further.</td></tr><tr><td>Final Draft and Documentation</td><td>Prepare a polished final draft ready for submission to the DAO.</td><td>Your draft is comprehensive, meets all guidelines, and has been reviewed by peers. It aligns with the DAO’s mission and is formatted correctly.</td><td>Ensure all sections are complete, proofread for clarity and consistency, final review by peers or advisors.</td></tr><tr><td>Building a Support Base</td><td>Gather endorsements and support from influential community members.</td><td>You have endorsements from key figures and have addressed any critical feedback received.</td><td>Engage with community leaders, gather endorsements, refine the proposal based on final feedback.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Creating a Detailed Implementation Plan

Now that you have a roadmap, let's drill down into how to execute it with a detailed implementation plan. Each phase should have clear steps, responsibilities, resources, and timelines to guide your team and communicate your plan to the community effectively.

#### Each of the 4 tabs here can be pulled into a singular document to start narrowing in and focusing your proposal with more clarity.&#x20;

#### **Breaking Down Your Journey**

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visual of a roadmap or journey map broken down]</mark>

**Focus on Defining the Specific Steps and Actions:** To ensure your project moves smoothly, it's essential to break down each phase into concrete steps. These steps act as the building blocks guiding your proposal from start to finish.

* **Key Actions to Include:**
  * **Research and Analysis**: Begin by identifying the core issue or opportunity your proposal aims to address. Utilize data collection, surveys, or stakeholder interviews to understand the landscape fully.
  * **Initial Development**: Start developing a basic version of your solution. This could range from mockups to prototypes, depending on the proposal.
  * **Testing and Refinement**: Test the initial version with potential users or community members. Gather insights and refine based on the feedback.
  * **Final Rollout Preparation**: Complete final adjustments and get ready for the official launch or implementation of your proposal.

**How to Know You're Ready to Move On:**

* All steps are clearly defined, and there is a consensus on what needs to be accomplished in each phase.
* Each action is time-bound and assigned to a responsible team member.
* A solid understanding of required resources is in place, and potential risks are identified.

**Quick Wins to Get Started:**

* Develop a one-page action plan summarising all steps.
* Set up initial meetings with stakeholders to validate your steps.

{% tab title="Assigning Responsibilities" %}
**Getting the Right People on Board**

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[visuals of people working together]</mark>

**Determining Who Does What:** Assigning roles and responsibilities is essential for ensuring smooth execution. Every team member should know exactly what their role is and what they are accountable for.

* **Effective Role Assignment:**
  * Identify the key competencies required for each task. Match these to your team members based on their skills, experience, and interests.
  * Be explicit in communicating responsibilities and deadlines. Transparency prevents overlaps and gaps in tasks.

**How to Know You're Ready to Move On:**

* All roles are matched to tasks, with clear accountability established.
* Every team member understands their responsibilities and has agreed to the set timeline.
* Backup plans are in place for any potential role changes or shifts in responsibilities.

**Example Quick Wins:**

* Use a collaboration tool to assign and track responsibilities.
* Conduct a kickoff meeting to align everyone on their roles and expectations.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">\[Visuals of allocation? Maybe multiple lines/points out of the centre?]</mark>

**Getting the Right Resources at the Right Time:**&#x20;

A successful proposal requires careful planning around the resources you will need, from funding and technology to people and tools. Ensuring these are allocated efficiently is key to maintaining momentum.

* **How to Allocate Resources Wisely:**
  * Create a resource map to visualize needs and gaps. This can be a simple table listing each phase, the required resources, and their availability.
  * Regularly review and adjust your allocation to meet evolving needs.

**How to Know You're Ready to Move On:**

* All necessary resources have been identified and secured.
* There is a plan in place for resource management and reallocation if needed.
* Potential risks related to resources are identified and mitigated.

**Quick Wins for Resource Allocation:**

* Set up a shared resource planning document accessible to all team members.
* Hold regular check-ins to discuss resource availability and constraints.

**Defining Your Project’s Timeline:**&#x20;

Clear timelines and milestones keep your project on track and ensure that progress is measurable. They also provide transparency to the community and stakeholders on your progress.

* **Crafting Your Timelines:**
  * Use tools like Gantt charts, Kanban boards, or Trello to visually track your project’s phases and milestones. This visualisation helps in understanding dependencies and planning effectively.
  * Set realistic milestones for each phase, like "User Feedback Round 1 Complete" or "Final Proposal Submission."

**How to Know You're Ready to Move On:**

* Milestones are well-defined, with clear deadlines.
* You have accounted for potential setbacks and have contingency plans in place.
* The community and stakeholders are informed and aligned on your timelines.

**Quick Wins to Establish Timelines:**

* Create a visual timeline using tools like Lucidchart or Trello.
* Share the timeline with your team and stakeholders for feedback and alignment.
