### Navigating the Review Process: What to Expect

Navigating the review process is crucial to getting your proposal approved. It involves several stages, each with its own requirements and expectations. Knowing what to expect at each stage will help you prepare effectively and avoid unnecessary delays.

{% hint style="info" %}
**How to Approach It**\
Think of the review process as a series of gates, each requiring a different approach. Be ready to adapt and respond at every step, whether it's addressing community feedback, aligning with the DAO's strategic goals, or mobilizing votes. The more you know about what's coming, the better prepared you'll be to clear every hurdle smoothly.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Informal Review" %}
**Engage with Community Feedback:** Begin by posting your draft in the ApeCoinDAO forum or relevant community spaces. Actively encourage feedback and constructive criticism from the community.

**Refine Your Proposal:** Use the feedback received to make necessary adjustments to your proposal, ensuring clarity, completeness, and alignment with the community's expectations.

**Recommended Duration:** 2-3 weeks, but stay flexible depending on the volume of feedback and revisions needed.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Formal Review" %}
**Address All Feedback:** After the informal review, ensure all critical feedback points have been addressed thoroughly. This will involve rewriting, adding missing sections, or refining specific elements to align with DAO goals.

**Align with DAO Goals:** Confirm that your proposal clearly supports the strategic objectives of the ApeCoinDAO. Use precise language and data to strengthen your arguments.

**Duration:** Plan for a 4-week period to polish the proposal and meet the formal submission criteria.

**Duration:** Typically 7 days; stay active and accessible throughout to maximise support.
{% endtab %}

### Building Community Support: Rallying Votes and Advocates

Building community support is a strategic process that involves more than just asking for votes. Before you begin rallying your supporters, ensure that you are prepared to engage with the community in meaningful and impactful ways.

{% hint style="info" %}
**How to Approach It**\
Think of your community outreach like running a campaign. It requires consistent messaging, engaging content, and targeted outreach to the right people. Make sure you have a plan in place that covers all of these aspects before you start reaching out.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Direct Outreach" %}
**Reach Key Stakeholders and Leaders:** \
Identify and reach out to influential community members and leaders who could be instrumental in promoting your proposal. Build relationships with them by sharing insights and gathering their input.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Host Community Calls" %}
**Q\&A Sessions:** Organize interactive Q\&A sessions where community members can ask questions and express concerns. This helps to build trust and demonstrate your transparency.

**Highlight Benefits:** Use these calls to clearly articulate the benefits of your proposal and how it aligns with the ApeCoinDAO's goals. Share real-world examples or data to back your claims.

**Guiding Tip:** "Think of these sessions as conversations, not presentations. Be prepared to listen as much as you speak."

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Quick Wins for Gaining Support" %}

### Before Handling Revisions or Rejections, Embrace the Feedback Loop

Rejections or requests for revisions aren’t the end; they're an opportunity to refine and improve. Before you dive into changes, take the time to thoroughly understand the feedback and how to use it to your advantage.

{% hint style="info" %}
**How to Approach It**\
Approach this process like a feedback loop designed to make your proposal stronger. Be open, receptive, and strategic in how you interpret the feedback. Use it as a tool to elevate your proposal and make it even more aligned with the community’s expectations.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Feedback Analysis" %}
**Identify Recurring Themes:** \
Carefully analyze the feedback you receive to identify common themes or concerns. Focus on areas that need the most attention or improvement.

**Prioritise Key Issues:** \
Determine which feedback points are critical to the success of your proposal and prioritise them in your revisions.

**Guiding Tip:**&#x20;

"Don't take feedback personally; view it as valuable insights to refine your proposal."
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Adaptation Strategy" %}
**Revise and Resubmit:** \
Make necessary adjustments based on the feedback while staying true to your core objectives. Plan a clear timeline for your resubmission and outline key changes.

**Develop a Plan:** \
Create a step-by-step strategy that includes what to revise, how to implement changes, and when to resubmit.

**Guiding Tip:** \
"A strong adaptation strategy shows resilience and commitment—qualities valued by any community."
{% endtab %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**How to Approach It**\

{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title=" Implementation Kick-Off: Start Strong!" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Celebrate Milestones: Acknowledge Your Supporters" %}

### Your AIP might be approved, but your journey doesn’t end here.

Remember that not all AIPs are approved on the first try. Some proposals may require resubmissions or revisions based on community feedback. Others might find alternative routes to success outside of the AIP process. It's important to recognise that grant funding is not the only way to build a sustainable project within the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem.

Think of this milestone—whether your AIP is approved now or later—as the beginning of your ongoing role in shaping the future of the ApeCoin DAO. Stay curious, stay engaged, and keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
