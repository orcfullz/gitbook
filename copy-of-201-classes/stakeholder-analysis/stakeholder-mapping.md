# Stakeholder Mapping

{% hint style="info" %}
**Stakeholder Mapping** helps you visualise where stakeholders fall in terms of their level of interest in your project and their ability to influence its outcome. This process allows you to prioritise your engagement efforts.
{% endhint %}

### **Use an Interest and Influence Matrix**

Place each stakeholder in a matrix based on their interest in your project and their ability to influence its outcome.

### **Definitions:**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Interest**: The degree to which a stakeholder is interested in the project.
{% endhint %}

| Level                    | High Interest                                                                                                                                                   | Medium Interest                                                                                                                  | Low Interest                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition               | Highly invested in the project's outcomes and processes.                                                                                                        | Interested in regular updates and major decisions.                                                                               | Minimal interest in project details.                                                                                       |
| Question to ask yourself | _"Is this stakeholder deeply invested in the outcomes and processes of my project? Are they actively seeking information or engaging in discussions about it?"_ | _"Does this stakeholder want regular updates and information about major decisions but is not deeply involved in every detail?"_ | _"Is this stakeholder only minimally interested in the project's details and outcomes, or only tangentially aware of it?"_ |

### **Questions to Determine Influence:**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Influence**: The degree to which a stakeholder can impact the project.
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="144">Level</th><th width="217">High Influence</th><th>Medium Influence</th><th>Low Influence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Definition</td><td>Significant influence over project outcomes.</td><td>Can influence some project decisions.</td><td>Limited ability to affect the project's direction.</td></tr><tr><td>Question to ask yourself</td><td><em>"Does this stakeholder have a significant ability to shape or change the direction of the project? Could their support or opposition dramatically affect the project's success?"</em></td><td><em>"Can this stakeholder influence some aspects of the project, such as specific decisions or phases, but not the overall direction?"</em></td><td><em>"Does this stakeholder have little to no ability to affect the project's direction or outcome?"</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Examples of what the outcome might look like

Your focus should be on arming yourself with the knowledge around the importance of and  level of communication you need to have with each of these stakeholders
