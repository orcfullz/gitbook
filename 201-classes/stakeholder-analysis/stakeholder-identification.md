# Stakeholder Identification

## **Stakeholders** are the individuals or groups who have an interest in your project or are affected by its outcomes.&#x20;

Identifying your stakeholders is the first step to engaging them effectively.

#### Step 1: Create a Stakeholder List

To effectively identify stakeholders, it's important to ask the right questions that help you understand who might be impacted by or interested in your project. Use these questions as a guide to create a comprehensive list of stakeholders and define their roles.

### Initial Questions to Identify Stakeholders

Before diving into your stakeholder strategy, start by identifying who has a vested interest in your AIP. Consider who might be affected by your proposal's success or failure, who needs to stay informed, and who will be directly impacted by the outcomes.&#x20;

These questions will help you build an initial list of potential stakeholders to engage with.

<details>

<summary>Who has an interest in the success or failure of the project?</summary>

Consider those who are not directly affected but who have a vested interest in the project's outcome. This could include people who support or oppose the project for various reasons.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Who needs to be informed about the project?</summary>

Identify individuals or groups who must be kept in the loop, even if they are not actively participating in the project. This could include higher-level decision-makers, regulatory bodies, or community members.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Who will be directly affected by the project’s outcomes?</summary>

Think about individuals or groups who will see a direct impact from the project's results. Are there people whose work, investment, or daily routines might change because of what you’re doing?

</details>

### Questions to Refine Your Stakeholder List

Once you have a preliminary list, it’s time to refine it by digging deeper. Clarify each stakeholder’s role in relation to your AIP, understand their interests, concerns, or motivations, and assess their level of influence over your proposal’s success.

<details>

<summary>What role does each stakeholder play in relation to the project?</summary>

Understand whether each stakeholder is an internal member shaping the community from within or an external player influencing from the outside. Recognise their unique position and potential impact—whether they are decision-makers, influencers, or those affected by the project's outcomes—so you can tailor your approach to engage them effectively.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are their interests, concerns, or motivations regarding the project?</summary>

Dive deeper into what truly drives each stakeholder. Are they motivated by financial returns, policy adherence, community growth, or something else entirely? By pinpointing their core motivations, you can align your proposal to address their concerns and highlight the benefits that matter most to them.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much influence do they have over the project's success or failure?</summary>

Evaluate the power dynamics at play. Determine who holds significant sway, whose support can accelerate your proposal, or whose opposition could stall it. Knowing their level of influence allows you to prioritize your efforts and strategically engage with those who can shape the project's direction and outcome.

### Here's some examples of breaking down and laying out stakeholders

When preparing your AIP, it's important to identify and categorise the different stakeholders involved in the ApeCoin DAO. Each group has its own role and influence within the community, from internal members who vote on proposals and contribute to discussions, to external partners and investors who collaborate on initiatives and bring resources into the ecosystem.&#x20;
